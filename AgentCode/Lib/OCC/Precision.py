The 'parametric tangent' at the point of parameter u of this curve is ten times greater than the previous one. This shows that for two different curves, the distance between two points on the curve, resulting from the same variation of parameter du, may vary considerably. - Moreover, the variation of the parameter along the curve is generally not proportional to the curvilinear abscissa along the curve. So the distance between two points resulting from the same variation of parameter du, at two different points of a curve, may completely differ. - Moreover, the parameterization of a surface may generate two quite different 'parametric tangent' values in the u or in the v parametric direction. - Last, close to the poles of a sphere (the points which correspond to the values -Pi/2. and Pi/2. of the v parameter) the u parameter may change from 0 to 2.Pi without impacting on the resulting point.
